This project is a web scraper built using Python, designed to extract news articles from the website cpc.bg. The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and parsel for parsing the HTML content. It navigates through multiple pages using pagination and scrapes news titles, dates, summaries, and full article details. The scraped data is processed by removing unnecessary punctuation and reformatting dates to a consistent format (YYYY-MM-DD). Finally, the collected data is saved into an Excel file using the pandas library. The program ensures seamless handling of cookies and headers for the requests.
